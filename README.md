Hello, I am Sergen Aktaş. I have experience in application development using C# programming language and technologies such as .Net Core, Asp.Net Web Forms, MVC, and WebApi. Additionally, I have worked on querying existing databases and creating new databases using SQL query language. I am proficient in consuming technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. I can develop projects by adopting the Onion and N-Tier layered architecture approach, utilizing Azure Cloud SQL.
